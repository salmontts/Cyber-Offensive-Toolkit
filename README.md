# 🛡️ Adrian Jedrocha – Cyber Offensive Toolkit

A collection of personal cybersecurity tools and scripts built for offensive operations – from real-time process monitoring to memory analysis and recon automation.

This toolkit is built with a hands-on mindset: **minimal, fast, and functional.** It’s meant for analysts, red teamers, and threat hunters who prefer code that just works.
